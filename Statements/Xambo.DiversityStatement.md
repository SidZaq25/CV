#Diversity statement

## Why diversity matters

A diverse environment is important for understanding to respect other points of view and facilitating rich collaborations. In the anthropology field it is said: *understanding "the other" helps to understand oneself*. In the field of music technology, as it also happens in other STEM fields, there is a well-known problem of lack of diversity. As a woman in music technology, I am particulary concerned about the lack of women in my field, and thus the lack of role models. 

## We are agents of change

We can be agents of change. As part of the [WAC 2016](http://webaudio.gatech.edu/) committee, we included a travel grant program that looked into increasing diversity in the WAC conference hosted at Georgia Tech, and had gender parity in [keynote speakers](http://webaudio.gatech.edu/keynotes). Even though all our efforts, the number of female attendees was low. What was the problem?

I took it as personal research and conducted a series of informal interviews with women in the field of music technology at different stages of their life: an undergrad student, two grad students, an early career lecturer, a high school teacher, and a music technology's program coordinator. In April 2016, I was invited to discuss these data as a [keynote conversation with Liz Dobson and I](http://wiswos.bitbucket.org/index.html%3Fp=435.html) at Women in Sound Women on Sound on Educating girls into Sound, held in Lancaster, UK. On my way back to Atlanta, we continued the discussion in the GTCMT department. Then, we decided to create [Women in Music Tech](http://www.gtcmt.gatech.edu/) to make sure that we sustainably bring more women into the program.

## Women in music tech

[Women in Music Tech](www.gtcmt.gatech.edu/womeninmusictech) is an exciting adventure. This organization has been possible with the collaboration of everyone in the GTCMT department: students and faculty members. We are also in conversations with a number of organizations and individuals from Georgia Tech that are supporting us and helping us to define our agenda. This year we have programmed an outreach event in the fall 2016. the launch of a monthly newsletter, and make sure that there is a safe and respectful space for everybody. Our next goal is to create a sustainable organization. 

## What else we can do?

As agents of change, we can improve our environment keeping updated and getting feedback from our colleagues about our organization's actions and achievements, and making the organization part of the department. Furthermore, attending events related to diversity, such as the [Diversity Symposium 2016](http://www.diversity.gatech.edu/diversitysymposium) at Georgia Tech, is important to network, join forces and share current issues and future strategies.
