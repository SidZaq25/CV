## Technology, Design, Experience

My research contributes to the fields of **HCI** and **sound & music computing** and has **three foci**:

* **Technology**: using cutting-edge technology in real-time interactive musical systems and creative algorithms borrowed from MIR and machine learning that can be useful for real-time performance and musical improvisation e.g. live coding or algorithmic music.
* **Design**: exploring novel aesthetics for real-time interactive musical systems e.g. tangible interfaces or wearable computing. 
* **Experience**: bringing more egalitarian, collaborative and participatory experiences to the fore e.g. multichannel experiences, participatory performances, DIY workshops. 

 
## Intelligent Computer-Supported Collaborative Work: Tangible Music Everywhere
 
I envision pushing the boundaries of **technology**, **design**, and **experience** towards more collaborative, egalitarian and sustainable spaces, what I term **tangible music everywhere**. My mission is to do interdisciplinary research that embraces techniques and research methods from engineering, social sciences, and the arts for creating a new generation of interactive music systems.

My area of expertise is HCI applied to the development of new technologies and user interfaces that promote new experiences. I am particularly interested in the creation of cutting-edge pedagogical interfaces that help to understand **STEM** (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) concepts, with the special use case of **music technology** because it can attract more diversity to the scientific fields. For example, see my work on the National Science Foundation funded project TuneTable, a musical tabletop for museums that promotes computational concepts by making music.

An interesting characteristic of these novel interfaces is their potential support to collaboration, an aspect that I have been working since my PhD. I am interested in further exploring **computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW)** applied to STEM with an special emphasis in **music technology education** and **intelligent CSCW systems** by means of **music information retrieval** and **machine learning** algorithms.
